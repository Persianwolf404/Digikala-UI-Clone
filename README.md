# 🛍️ Digikala UI Clone

**Digikala UI Clone** is a **pixel-perfect desktop UI replica** of Iran’s largest e-commerce platform. Built purely for visual accuracy using modern tools, this project recreates the **static layout** and **styling** of Digikala — without any backend or interactivity.

> ⚠️ This is a **static UI only**. Buttons and features are non-functional.  
> ⚠️ **Mobile responsiveness is not supported** — best viewed on large screens.
